Our model checkpoints trained on [VITON-HD](https://github.com/shadow2496/VITON-HD) (half-body) and [Dress Code](https://github.com/aimagelab/dress-code) (full-body) have been released

* 📢📢 We support ONNX for [humanparsing](https://github.com/GoGoDuck912/Self-Correction-Human-Parsing) now. Most environmental issues should have been addressed : )
* Please also download [clip-vit-large-patch14](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14) into ***checkpoints*** folder
* We've only tested our code and models on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)
